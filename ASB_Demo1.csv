ASB_Title,"Ashes Scenario Builder Demo"
Step1,"Welcome to the Ashes Scenario Builder."
Step1_1,"Welcome to the Ashes Scenarion Builder!"
Step1_2,"This scenario has been created to show you the fundamentals of how to make a scenario/mission in Ashes of the Singularity"
Step1_3,"When played, this scenario will be very bare bones and, to be honest, not very fun to actually play"
Step1_4,"However, if you open this scenario in the Ashes Scenario Builder and follow along with the Triggers, this scenario may prove quite useful as a quick crash course on how to make a scenario of your own"
Step1_5,"To open this scenario, start the Ashes Scenario builder and go to open in the File menu. There you will have to open both ASB_Demo1.xml AND ASB_Demo1.csv to load both the scenario and its text"
Step1_6,"Immediately you should see details relating to this scenario's map, title, and other parts of the game that need to be hooked up to the scenario"
Step1_7,"At the top you should see 3 buttons: mission, players, and triggers. These are your main tabs"
Step1_8,"If you were to take a look at the player tab, you would see the players in this scenario. These include you, and AI player, and an inactive NPC"
Step1_9,"Select the Triggers tab to find the the meat of the scenario's programming."
Step1_10,"Click the Edit button on the Trigger labeled Step1_Configuration to locate the Trigger we are in right now."
Step1_11,"A Trigger contains parameters for its own activation and a list of actions to carry out after those parameters have been met."
Step1_12,"This Trigger is this scenario's configuration Trigger, which is a Trigger that activates instantly using a timer of 0 seconds that typically halts player activity in order to set things up without the player seeing, which may be done via actions that move the camera and letterbox rhe screen"
Step1_13,"Please click on the Dialog action to open the Dialog Editor if you have not done so already"
Step1_14,"To find the current part of the Dialog sequence, scroll down the list and click on the entry spoken by Haalee rather than Artix"
Step1_15,"Here you will find controls to edit the speaker, their subtitles, and the audio file for their VO if one is available. Like the title, description, and other UI text, the dialogue is saved via a pairing of a key and translated string. The key is stored in the XML code so that when the game reads it, it will fetch the corresponding translated string in the matching CSV file. This makes saving both the XML AND CSV files very important."
Step1_16,"After this Dialog Action, you should also see a Camera Action. Camera Actions are used to change the position and angle of the in-game camera. In the Camera Action in this Trigger, we are simply saving the state of the camera at the beginning of the game."
Step1_17,"There are also Restrict Actions. These are used to toggle what is and is not allowed to be used in the mission from buildings to orbitals. In this example we have a Restrict of each type. Refrences to acceptable values can be found in the Ashes Scenario Builder Documentation."
Step1_18,"After the Restrict Actions you will find a HidePanel Action. A HidePanel Action's job is simply to hide in-game UI elements. In this example we are hiding the ranking panel and resource panel completely arbitrarily."
Step1_19,"That will be it for the configuration trigger. If you want to read ahead without reading this dialogue in Ashes of the Singularity, simply read along in the CSV file. All dialogue has been laid out in sequential order and should be quite easy to follow. After you have opened ASB_Demo1.csv, close this Dialog Editor window and the Trigger window. All progress in the Ashes Scenario Builder is saved automatically."
Step1_20,"Now please navigate to the Trigger labeled Step2_Setup. This Trigger is an example of a setup Trigger, which is a way of spawning all of the buildings and units right in the beginning of the game."
Step2_1,"Setup Triggers typically fire at the beginning of the game at the same time as the config Trigger using a Timer set to 0."
Step2_2,"This example setup Trigger only spawns one building and three units for clarity reasons, but you can spawn as many buildings and units as you want in as many setup Triggers as you want, provided you do not crash the game."
Step2_3,"In the SpawnBuilding and Spawn Unit actions you can choose where buildings and units spawn, who they belong to, and what kind of unit or building they are. Valid values are located in CSV files in the Assets folder under GameCore, and are loaded automatically by the Ashes Scenario Builder."
Step2_4,"You can also assign them internal names which other actions and Triggers can reference. For example, you can use these internal names to organize units into metaunits, as illustrated with U1 and U2."
Step2_5,"You can also set units to be invulnerable, as illustrated with the unit named YourUnit."
Step2_6,"Unfortunately, at the present there is no way of finding map position coordinates without using Ashes of the Singularity's in-game debug tools."
Step2_7,"There is also an ActivateTrigger Action, which activates another Trigger directly using that Trigger's name."
Step2_8,"Now please look at the Trigger named Step3_DifficultySettings."
Step3_1,"Step3_DifficultySettings is an example of a Difficulty Trigger, which is a Trigger that is activated only if a specific difficulty is selected. Which difficulty activates the Trigger can be changed in the same way timers are adjusted."
Step3_2,"Difficulty is usually managed by buffing the players' HP and damage output via the GrantTech Action. This action should be pretty straight forward: select the buff, the player, and the number of times to buff that player."
Step4_1,"The Trigger Step4_Start is just more of the same, only if you pay close attention, it is a Timer Trigger with Inactive set to true."
Step4_2,"This prevents the Trigger from activating without the use of an ActivateTrigger Action like the one used in Step2_Setup."
Step4_3,"This Trigger starts with a Dialog Action where the dialogue will carry on from where the previous dialogue sequence left off."
Step4_4,"This Trigger also uses a Reveal Action, which makes a given area visible to the player via regular vision or radar."
Step4_5,"In addition to being revealed, this area will be highlighted in green via an AreaIndicator Action."
Step4_6,"This Trigger ends with a LetterBox Action with Enable set to false, allowing the player to take control."
Step5_1,"The next Trigger, Step5_Area Triggers, is an Area trigger, meaning it will only activate when the player has moved a unit within the boundaries set in the Trigger."
Step5_2,"In this case, this Trigger will activate when the character moves to the area highlighted by the previous Trigger."
Step5_3,"The first Action this Trigger carries out is moving the camera to the location of U1 and U2."
Step5_4,"After this, an AttackAttackMove Action is carried out, which moves U1 to your position."
Step5_5,"Then a Dialog action is fired where the dialogue sequence has resumed where the previous one left off."
Step5_6,"After the dialogue concludes, player 0 (you) is given 3 metal via the GrantStuff action, which grants a player(or all players) specified resources."
Step5_7,"Following this, the announcer notifications are turned off and the single AI player(player 2) is set to beginner difficulty."
Step5_8,"At the end of this Trigger, the AreaIndicator previously created is deactivated by making an AreaIndicator Action of the same name with On unchecked, and then a Camera Action loads the camera state previously saved in the first Trigger."
Step5_9,"The next Trigger will fire when the player destroys the unit internally named U1."
Step6_1,"As previously stated, the Trigger Step6_Destruction Triggers is activated when its Target, U1, is destroyed."
Step6_2,"In this Trigger the dialogue is resumed, the AreaIndicator is created(this time in red), and the AI is turned off. A sound effect is played and an objective is marked in the UI."
Objective1,"Capture the indicated area with your Nemesis"
Step6_3,"This Trigger will also destroy the enemy listening post, B1, to illustrate that Actions can also destroy buildings and units spawned by the scenario."
Step6_4,"The next Trigger will activate after the player takes control of the area highlighted by the AreaIndicator."
Step7_1,"Step7_ZoneCapture Triggers is a ZoneCapture Trigger, which is a Trigger that fires when a specified point on the map lies within area that belongs to a certain player."
Step7_2,"Triggers can also be Triggered by multiple names. In this example, Step7_ZoneCapture Triggers will also activate if the player activates Step8_Research Triggers"
Step7_3,"The Actions in this Trigger check the previously objective, resume dialogue, highlights your research UI, and sets a new Objective to research metal storage."
Objective2,"Research metal storage"
Step7_4,"The player must complete that objective to activate the next Trigger."
Step8_1,"The Trigger labeled Step8_Research Triggers activates when a player researches a targeted field(valid values are lacated in a CSV file in the Assets file under GameCore). In this case, when the player researches metal storage."
Step8_2,"This Trigger's Actions saves the state of the camera, moves the camera to a new location, resumes dialogue, spawns a dreadnought, and checks off that last objective."
Step8_3,"The next Trigger should fire immediately, as it is activated when U3, the dreadnought, is created."
Step9_1,"Step9_NamedCreate Triggers is a NamedCreate Trigger, which is a trigger when a building or unit of a given name is spawned. In this case, it was waiting for a unit named U3 to be spawned."
Step9_2,"Apart from carrying on the dialogue, this Trigger also has an action to destroy U3, in action not unlike the one used to destroy the building earlier."
Step9_3,"The next Trigger should also fire immediately after dialogue is concluded, as it is another Destruction Trigger, which was waiting for U3 to be destroyed."
Step10_1,"Step_10 Ending is the final Trigger, featuring the EndMission Action, which ends the mission in either a victory or a defeat."
Step10_2,"As soon as dialogue concludes, this scenario will end."
Step10_3,"If you have further questions, documentation all of the Triggers and Actions can be found in a help file in same folder as the Ashes Scenario Builder itself. "
