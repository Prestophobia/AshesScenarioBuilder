Before you go in editing pre-existing scenarios and campaign missions, I have a few warnings.
REMEMBER THESE:
-The Scenario Builder can only read files that are XML COMPLIANT. Many of the scenarios and missions in Ashes(as of 9/2/16)
 are hand-made and sloppily take advantage of Ashes's "generous" XML Parser, using double hyphens in comments and creating 
duplicate attributes. The Scenario Builder's parser isn't so generous, unfortunately, so if it crashes on opening a file, this
is likely why

-The Scenario Builder is completely blind to comments, and as such will not write them. If you were to open a hand-made scenario in
the builder and then overwrite it, the comments will be removed. The Scenario Builder is built such that making scenarios should be 
intuitive enough to not need such documentation, but just in case always store a backup of a hand-made xml file before editing it
in the builder to preserve the author's comments. 

-the Scenario Builder still requires the use of the Ashes debug menu for finding map coordinates and referencing the game's internal
names for units.
